# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Decision-Tree-Machine-Learning-Classifier
Breast cancer is a dangerous disease for women. If it does not identify in the early-stage then the result will be the death of the patient. It is a common cancer in women worldwide. Worldwide near about 12% of women affected by breast cancer and the number is still increasing.
The doctors do not identify each and every breast cancer patient. That’s the reason Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist comes into the picture because they have knowledge of maths and computational power.

Machine learning is widely used in bio informatics and particularly in breast cancer diagnosis. In this project, we have used certain classification methods such as Decision Tree Classification which is a supervised learning method to detect breast cancer. Cancer diagnosis is one of the most studied problems in the medical domain. Several researchers have focused in order to improve performance and achieved to obtain satisfactory results. Early detection of cancer is essential for a rapid response and better chances of cure. Unfortunately, early detection of cancer is often difﬁcult because the symptoms of the disease at the beginning are absent. Thus, it is necessary to discover and interpret new knowledge to prevent and minimize the risk adverse consequences.

To understand this problem more precisely, tools are needed to help oncologists to choose the treatment required for healing or prevention of recurrence by reducing the harmful effects of certain treatments and their costs. In artiﬁcial intelligent, machine learning is a discipline which allows the machine to evolve through a process. Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained by the university of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
